## Proposal

Title:

*Application of Reinforcement Learning in Mobile Robotics*

Short description:

*The problem being considered consists of learning end-to-end how to control a robot using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The proposed technique is to apply SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) algorithm to learn from sensor data how to control a robot. For this work, the target robot is the P3DX in V-REP simulation.*
