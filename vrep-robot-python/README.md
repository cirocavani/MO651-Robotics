This project contains the basic structure to control a Pioneer P3DX robot on the V-REP simulator and read its sensors.

# Running

First, you have to ...

After this, you can load the scene p3dx.ttt in V-REP. This scene contains a [Pioneer P3Dx](https://www.generationrobots.com/media/Pioneer3DX-P3DX-RevA.pdf) robot, with a Hokuyo Laser sensor and a vision sensor attached to it.

Always remember to Start the simulation **before** running your code.
